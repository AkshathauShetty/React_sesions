Hooks in react :



1) useState(<initialState.)

[count,setCount]=useState(0)

setCount(count+1) -> allows to update thestate, 

Note:

setState=> is an asynchronous function, read the state in the useEffect hook.


Arrowfunction with the set state method:

(normal function differs from arrow function with the use of this, arguments and new keywords)

setState method can accept :
1> an object as parameter 
2>  a function => which accepts a previous state and props, return a object.



stale updates:

setState(count+1)
setState(count+1)
the second may be called on the state, which is not updated yet as the setState function is asynchronous.

. However, when a function is used, React guarantees that the previous state and the props are the most recent ones when the function is executed
